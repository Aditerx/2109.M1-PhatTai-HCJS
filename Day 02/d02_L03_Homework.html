    <h1>The Orchid Flower, Its Meanings and Symbolism</h1>
    <hr>
    <x>O</x>rchids are the largest family of blooming flowers with over 
    25,000 species and over 100,000 varieties. They are often 
    grown as houseplants, or added to floral displays. 
    But, not all orchids are tropical beauties. Wild orchids 
    grow worldwide and can be found on every continent except 
    <strong>Antarctica</strong>. These flowers have earned the 
    reputation as difficult to grow, probably due to their need 
    for filtered light and high relative humidity. Many varieties, 
    such as the moth orchid (<b><i>Phalaenopsis</i></b>) are 
    surprisingly easy to grow as a houseplant.
