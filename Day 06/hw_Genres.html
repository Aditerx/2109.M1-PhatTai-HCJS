                    American communities in the mid-1960s when musicians 
                    created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music 
                    through a mixture of soul, jazz, and rhythm and 
                    blues (R&B).

                    <h3>Hip hop</h3>
                    Hip Hop music, also referred to as hip hop or rap 
                    music, is a genre of music that was started in the 
                    United States, specifically the South Bronx in the 
                    New York City by African-American youth from the 
                    inner cities during the 1970s. It can be broadly 
                    defined as a stylized rhythmic music that commonly 
                    accompanies rapping,[27] a rhythmic and rhyming speech 
                    that is chanted.[28] Hip hop music derives from the 
                    hip hop culture itself, including four key elements: 
                    emceeing (MCing)/rapping, Disc jockeying (DJing) with 
                    turntablism, breakdancing and graffiti art.

                    Louisiana, United States, in the late 19th and

                    Pop is a genre of popular music that originated 
                    in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the 
                    United States and the United Kingdom. The terms 
                    popular music and pop music are often used 
                    interchangeably, although the former describes 
                    all music that is popular and includes many disparate 
                    styles.
